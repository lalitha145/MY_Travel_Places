    <h1>Grand Canyon National Park,USA</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Grand Canyon National Park, located in northwestern Arizona, is the 15th
      site in the United States to have been named as a national park. The
      park's central feature is the Grand Canyon, a gorge of the Colorado River,
      which is often considered one of the Wonders of the World. The park, which
      covers 1,217,262 acres (1,901.972 sq mi; 4,926.08 km2) of unincorporated
      area in Coconino and Mohave counties, received more than six million
      recreational visitors in 2017, which is the second highest count of all
      American national parks after Great Smoky Mountains National Park.[5] The
      Grand Canyon was designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1979. The
      park celebrated its 100th anniversary on February 26, 2019.The Grand
      Canyon, including its extensive system of tributary canyons, is valued for
      its combination of size, depth, and exposed layers of colorful rocks
      dating back to Precambrian times. The canyon itself was created by the
      incision of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado
      Plateau was uplifted, causing the Colorado River system to develop along
      its present path. The primary public areas of the park are the South and
      North Rims, and adjacent areas of the canyon itself. The rest of the park
      is extremely rugged and remote, although many places are accessible by
      pack trail and backcountry roads. The South Rim is more accessible than
      the North Rim and accounts for 90% of park visitation.[16] The park
      headquarters are at Grand Canyon Village, not far from the South Entrance
      to the park, near one of the most popular viewpoints.
