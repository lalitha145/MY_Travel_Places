    <h1>Cappadocia,Turkey</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Cappadocia (/kæpəˈdoʊʃə/; also Capadocia; Ancient and Modern Greek:
      Καππαδοκία, romanized: Kappadokía, from Old Persian: 𐎣𐎫𐎱𐎬𐎢𐎣, romanized:
      Katpatuka, Armenian: Կապադովկիա, Գամիրք, romanized: Kapadovkia, Gamirk',
      Turkish: Kapadokya) is a historical region in Central Anatolia, largely in
      the Nevşehir, Kayseri, Kırşehir, Aksaray, Malatya, Sivas and Niğde
      provinces in Turkey. Since the late 300s BC the name Cappadocia came to be
      restricted to the inland province (sometimes called Great Cappadocia),
      Upper Cappadocia, which alone will be the focus of this article. Lower
      Cappadocia is focused to elsewhere. According to Herodotus,[1] in the time
      of the Ionian Revolt (499 BC), the Cappadocians were reported as occupying
      a region from Mount Taurus to the vicinity of the Euxine (Black Sea).
      Cappadocia, in this sense, was bounded in the south by the chain of the
      Taurus Mountains that separate it from Cilicia, to the east by the upper
      Euphrates, to the north by Pontus, and to the west by Lycaonia and eastern
      Galatia.[2] The name, traditionally used in Christian sources throughout
      history, continues in use as an international tourism concept to define a
      region of exceptional natural wonders, in particular characterized by
      fairy chimneys and a unique historical and cultural heritage. Cappadocia
      lies in central Anatolia, in the heartland of what is now Turkey. The
      relief consists of a high plateau over 1000 m in altitude that is pierced
      by volcanic peaks, with Mount Erciyes (ancient Argaeus) near Kayseri
      (ancient Caesarea) being the tallest at 3916 m. The boundaries of
      historical Cappadocia are vague, particularly towards the west. To the
      south, the Taurus Mountains form the boundary with Cilicia and separate
      Cappadocia from the Mediterranean Sea. To the west, Cappadocia is bounded
      by the historical regions of Lycaonia to the southwest, and Galatia to the
      northwest. Due to its inland location and high altitude, Cappadocia has a
      markedly continental climate, with hot dry summers and cold snowy
      winters.[7] Rainfall is sparse and the region is largely semi-arid.
