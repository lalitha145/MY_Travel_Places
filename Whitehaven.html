    <h1>WhiteHaven Beach,Australia</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Whitehaven Beach is a 7 km stretch along Whitsunday Island, Australia. The
      island is accessible by boat, seaplane & helicopter from Airlie Beach, as
      well as Hamilton Island. It lies across from Stockyard Beach, better known
      as Chalkie's Beach, on Haslewood Island. The beach is known for its
      crystal white silica sands and turquoise coloured waters. The beach has
      tour barbeque and camping facilities.The beach was awarded Queensland's
      Cleanest Beach in Keep Australia Beautiful's 2008 Beach Challenge State
      Awards.[2] In July 2010, Whitehaven Beach was named the top Eco Friendly
      Beach in the world by CNN.com.[3] Dogs are not permitted on the beach and
      cigarette smoking is prohibited.[2] Whitehaven Beach is known for its
      bright white sands, which consist of 98% pure silica. Local rocks do not
      contain silica so it has been suggested that the sands were brought to the
      beach by prevailing sea currents over millions of years.[4] Unlike regular
      sand, the sand on Whitehaven Beach does not retain heat making it
      comfortable to walk barefoot on a hot day. This sand is also very fine,
      and can damage electronic equipment such as telephones and cameras,
      although it is good at polishing up jewellery.Tourists and locals visit
      Whitehaven Beach to swim and take in the bright white sand. Some visitors
      eat a BBQ lunch,[6] and campers can stay by booking the National Parks
      camp facilities.[7] The Whitehaven Beach Ocean Swim is a 2 km open
      swimming competition held on the beach in November each year since 2009 as
      part of the Hamilton Island Triathlon. The 2012 event was held on 11
      November 2012.[8] The beach was also featured in the racing video game
      Forza Horizon 3.[9] In 2018, the government announced an investment of
      $3.9 million for the construction of a new long-distance walking track and
      upgrading of the camping areas on the Island to improve the holiday
      experience of the visitors. The track will connect Whitehaven Beach to the
      Tongue Point.
