    <h1>The Fairy Pools,Scotland</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      The Fairy Pools are a natural waterfall phenomenon in Glen Brittle on the
      Isle of Skye. The pools are a vivid aqua blue[1] and are a popular place
      for wild swimmers who brave the frigid waters.[2] The habitat of the Fairy
      Pools hosts a variety of animals, such as red deer, rabbits, and sheep.
      The area is also host to a large number of birds. Large flocks of crows,
      ravens, and gulls are present in the area, as well as such smaller birds
      as meadow pipits, turnstones, common ringed plovers, grey herons, dunlins,
      and curlews. The physical landscape is predominantly rocky, with some
      boggy areas here and there. The water in the area is typically cold, as
      the pools are fed by mountain streams.[3] From being unnamed and virtually
      unrecognised as a tourist attraction, the Fairy Pools have become a
      soaringly popular location for walkers, with visitor numbers doubling
      between 2015 and 2019.[4][5] It is about a 20 minute walk to the Fairy
      Pools from the Glen Brittle car park. The Fairy Pools are a natural
