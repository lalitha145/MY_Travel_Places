    <h1>Plitvice lakes,Croatia</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Plitvice Lakes National Park (Croatian: Nacionalni park Plitvička jezera,
      colloquially Plitvice, pronounced [plîtʋitse]) is one of the oldest and
      largest national parks in Croatia.[2] In 1979, Plitvice Lakes National
      Park was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list, due to its
      outstanding and picturesque series of tufa lakes, caves, connected by
      waterfalls.[3] The national park was founded in 1949 and is in the
      mountainous karst area of central Croatia, at the border to Bosnia and
      Herzegovina. The important north–south road that passes through the
      national park area connects the Croatian inland with the Adriatic coastal
      region. The protected area extends over 296.85 square kilometres (73,350
      acres). About 90% of this area is part of Lika-Senj County, while the
      remaining 10% is part of Karlovac County. Each year, more than 1 million
      visitors are recorded.[4][1] Entrance is subject to variable charges, up
      to 250 kuna or around €34 per adult per day in summer 2018.[5]The national
      park is world-famous for its lakes arranged in cascades. Sixteen lakes can
      be seen from the surface.[6] These lakes are a result of the confluence of
      several small rivers and subterranean karst rivers. The lakes are all
      interconnected and follow the water flow. They are separated by natural
      dams of travertine, which is deposited by the action of moss, algae, and
      bacteria. The particularly sensitive travertine barriers are the result of
      an interplay between water, air and plants. The encrusted plants and
      bacteria accumulate on top of each other, forming travertine barriers
      which grow at the rate of about 1 cm (0.4 in) per year. The 16 lakes are
      separated into an upper and lower cluster formed by runoff from the
      mountains, descending from an altitude of 636 to 503 m (2,087 to 1,650 ft)
      over a distance of some 8 kilometres (5.0 mi), aligned in a south–north
      direction. The lakes collectively cover an area of about 0.77 square
      miles, the water exiting from the lowest lake forming the Korana River.
      The lakes are renowned for their distinctive colors, ranging from azure to
      green, grey or blue. The colors change constantly depending on the
      quantity of minerals or organisms in the water and the angle of
      sunlight.[7]The name Plitvice was first mentioned in a written document in
      1777 by Dominik Vukasović, the priest of Otočac.[8] This name was
      designated due to natural phenomena that have created the lakes. Nature
      formed shallow basins (Croatian pličina or plitvak, plitko means shallow),
      which have been filled with water. For centuries, water has changed the
      limestone and thus the landscape of this area. The emerging travertine
      barriers decelerated and retained the flowing water. These dams are
      continuously growing in height.[9] Some scientists refer to the river
      Plitvica as origin of the name. This little river flows into the Plitvice
      Lakes at the lower and final part of the lakes. A nearby village bears the
      same name. The water masses of the Plitvice Lakes continue as Korana river
      in northern direction. The national park became famous during the 1960s
      and 1970s through several Western film productions of Karl May novels.
      Many scenes have been shot at the lakes or waterfalls.
