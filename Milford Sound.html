    <h1>Milford Sound,New Zealand</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Milford Sound / Piopiotahi is a fiord in the south west of New Zealand's
      South Island within Fiordland National Park, Piopiotahi (Milford Sound)
      Marine Reserve, and the Te Wahipounamu World Heritage site. It has been
      judged the world's top travel destination in an international survey (the
      2008 Travelers' Choice Destinations Awards by TripAdvisor)[2][3] and is
      acclaimed as New Zealand's most famous tourist destination.[4] Rudyard
      Kipling had previously called it the eighth Wonder of the World.[5] The
      fiord is most commonly accessed via road (State Highway 94) by tour coach,
      with the road terminating at a small village also called Milford Sound. As
      a fiord, Milford Sound was formed by a process of glaciation over millions
      of years. The village at the end of the fiord is also known as Milford
      Sound. Milford Sound runs 15 kilometres inland from the Tasman Sea at Dale
      Point (also named after a location close to Milford Haven in Wales)—the
      mouth of the fiord—and is surrounded by sheer rock faces that rise 1,200
      metres (3,900 ft) or more on either side. Among the peaks are The Elephant
      at 1,517 metres (4,977 ft), said to resemble an elephant's head,[7] and
      The Lion, 1,302 metres (4,272 ft), in the shape of a crouching lion.[8]
      Milford Sound sports two permanent waterfalls, Lady Bowen Falls and
      Stirling Falls.[9] After heavy rain temporary waterfalls can be seen
      running down the steep sided rock faces that line the fiord. They are fed
      by rain water drenched moss and will last a few days at most once the rain
      stops.[citation needed]With a mean annual rainfall of 6,412 mm (252 in)
      each year, a high level even for the West Coast, Milford Sound is known as
      the wettest inhabited place in New Zealand and one of the wettest in the
      world. Rainfall can reach 250 mm (10 in) during a span of 24 hours.[10]
      The rainfall creates dozens of temporary waterfalls (as well as a number
      of major, more permanent ones) cascading down the cliff faces, some
      reaching a thousand metres in length. Smaller falls from such heights may
      never reach the bottom of the sound, drifting away in the wind.
      Accumulated rainwater can, at times, cause portions of the rain forest to
      lose their grip on the sheer cliff faces, resulting in tree avalanches
      into the fiord. The regrowth of the rain forest after these avalanches can
      be seen in several locations along the sound.
