    <h1>Salar de Uyuni,Bolivia</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Salar de Uyuni (or Salar de Tunupa)[1] is the world's largest salt flat,
      or playa, at over 10,000 square kilometres (3,900 sq mi) in area.[2] It is
      in the Daniel Campos Province in Potosí in southwest Bolivia, near the
      crest of the Andes at an elevation of 3,656 meters (11,995 ft) above sea
      level.[3] The Salar was formed as a result of transformations between
      several prehistoric lakes. It is covered by a few meters of salt crust,
      which has an extraordinary flatness with the average elevation variations
      within one meter over the entire area of the Salar. The crust serves as a
      source of salt and covers a pool of brine, which is exceptionally rich in
      lithium. The large area, clear skies, and exceptional flatness of the
      surface make the Salar ideal for calibrating the altimeters of Earth
      observation satellites.[4][5][6][7][8] Following rain, a thin layer of
      dead calm water transforms the flat into the world's largest mirror, 129
      kilometers (80 miles) across.[9] The Salar serves as the major transport
      route across the Bolivian Altiplano and is a prime breeding ground for
      several species of flamingos. Salar de Uyuni is also a climatological
      transitional zone since the towering tropical cumulus congestus and
      cumulonimbus incus clouds that form in the eastern part of the salt flat
      during the summer cannot permeate beyond its drier western edges, near the
      Chilean border and the Atacama Desert.[citation needed] Salar has been
      used as a filming location for movies such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi
      (2017; as planet Crait),[10][11] The Fall (2006), Salt and Fire (2016),
      The Unseen (2017), and several others.The geological history of the Salar
      is associated with a sequential transformation between several vast lakes.
      Some 30,000 to 42,000 years ago, the area was part of a giant prehistoric
      lake, Lake Minchin. Its age was estimated by radiocarbon dating shells
      from outcropping sediments and carbonate reefs and varies between reported
      studies. Lake Minchin (named after Juan B. Minchin of Oruro[13]) later
      transformed into Paleo Lake Tauca having a maximal depth of 140 meters
      (460 ft), and an estimated age of 13,000 to 18,000 or 14,900 to 26,100
      years, depending on the source. The youngest prehistoric lake was Coipasa,
      which was radiocarbon dated to 11,500 to 13,400 years ago. When it dried,
      it left behind two modern lakes, Poopó and Uru Uru, and two major salt
      deserts, Salar de Coipasa and the larger Salar de Uyuni. Salar de Uyuni
      spreads over 10,582 km2, which is roughly 100 times the size of the
      Bonneville Salt Flats in the United States. Lake Poopó is a neighbor of
      the much larger Lake Titicaca. During the wet season, Titicaca overflows
      and discharges into Poopó, which in turn, floods Salar De Coipasa and
      Salar de Uyuni.
