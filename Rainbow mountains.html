    <h1>Rainbow mountains,China</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      The Rainbow Mountains of China within the Zhangye Danxia Landform
      Geological Park are a geological wonder of the world. These famous Chinese
      mountains are known for their otherworldly colors that mimic a rainbow
      painted over the tops of rolling mountains. The Zhangye Danxia National
      Park is located in the Gansu province in China’s northwest covering 200
      square miles. The site was named a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009 and
      is the destination for many Chinese and international tourists. Zhangye
      Danxia Landform Geological Park is very popular among tourists, and it has
      been listed among the ‘most beautiful’ places in China and the world,
      numerous times. It rests in the foothills of the Qilian Mountains. The
      national park encompasses an area of 124 square miles (322 sq km). The
      national park, originally named Zhangye Danxia Geopark, is renowned for
      the stunning display of colors across hills and rock formations. The
      Chinese media designated the region as one of the most amazing landscapes
      across China. The rock formations and rolling hills almost look as if they
      were painted. The landscapes are surreal. It would be fair to say that
      Zhangye National Geopark is the most colorful national park in the world.
      The colorful landscapes were created by sandstone and minerals being
      layered atop each other over the years with the tectonic plates shifting
      creating angled painted layers across the rock formation and sandstone
      rolling hills. Rain, wind, and time have further sculpted the rock
      formations and rolling hills into various displays of pillars and ravines.
      The erosion and tectonic plates have worked together to create amazing
      patterns to be viewed by all.China isn’t the only place where you can find
      a rainbow-colored mountain. Deep in the Peruvian Andes, Vinicna Mountain —
      known as Montana de Colores or Rainbow Mountain — was formed in the same
      way.
