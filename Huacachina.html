    <h1>Huacachina,Peru</h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
      Huacachina is built around a small natural desert lake, commonly referred
      to as the "oasis of America". According to local legends, the water and
      mud of the area is therapeutic. Both locals and tourists often bathe in
      the waters or cover themselves with the mud in an attempt to cure ailments
      such as arthritis, rheumatism, asthma and bronchitis.[5] Legend holds that
      the lagoon was created when a beautiful native princess removed her
      clothes to bathe, but after looking in a mirror she saw a male hunter
      approaching her from behind. Startled at the intrusion, she fled the area,
      leaving behind her mirror, which turned into a lake.[6] Other versions
      hold that she fled, leaving the pool of water she had been bathing in to
      become the lagoon. The folds of her mantle, streaming behind her as she
      ran, became the surrounding sand dunes. The woman herself is rumoured to
      still live in the oasis as a mermaid.[7] The lake was created by natural
      seepage from the underground aquifers, but the increase in well-drilling
      started to threaten that supply in the early 2000s.[8][9] To compensate
      for this loss, and preserve the oasis as a destination for tourists, local
      business groups began pumping water into the lake in 2015.[10] It was
      announced in 2016 that the Peruvian scientist Marino Morikawa, who created
      a nanobubble system to decontaminate lake El Cascajo, will lead a project
      to restore the Huacachina lagoon.[11][12] As of 2020, no further news of
      the proposal has been forthcoming. Huacachina is a village built around a
      small oasis and surrounded by sand dunes in southwestern Peru. It is about
      five kilometers from the city of Ica in the Ica District of Ica
      Province.[1] The oasis was introduced as a feature on the back of the 50
      nuevo sol note in 1991. Huacachina has a permanent population of around
      100 people,[2] although it hosts many tens of thousands of tourists each
      year.
